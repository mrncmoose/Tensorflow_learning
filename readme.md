# Tensor Flow Learning

There are many Jupyter books provided by Tensor Flow for education.  However, they all have major problem:  One does not learn much by clicking a button to run someone else's work.

The code here is an augment to the Jupyter noteboooks.  Much of the code is the same, but the key difference is these run in a shell much like Machine Learning will be run in the real world.  Therefore this is a much more real world learning and can be extened to solve real world problems.

## Use
1. Clone this repository
1. Run setup.sh
1. Start running Tensor Flow code to learn how it works.
